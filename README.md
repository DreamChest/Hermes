## Quickstart

### Requirements

- Ruby 2.4.x
- Rails 5.1.x
- ImageMagick (or at least MagickCore and MagickWand libs)
- PostgreSQL & libpq

For Ruby installation, RVM (or equivalent) is recommended.

### Installation

To install Hermes, make sure to meet the above requirements and get the current stable release with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DreamChest/Hermes
$ cd Hermes
$ bundle install
```

Alternatively, instead of cloning the repository, you can download the latest release for the releases pages.

### Configuration

#### Database config

You need to place your database config at **config/database.yml**, a sample config file is located at **config/database.example.yml**.

The example config file assumes the UNIX user running Hermes is associated with a Postgres user/role and has the permission to create databases.

You can then setup the database with `RAILS_ENV=production rake db:setup`.

#### Secrets config

To run Hermes you need to generate an encrypted secrets file with `rails secrets:setup` and then edit the encrypted file with `rails secrets:edit`. The file should at least contain:

```
production:
  secret_key_base: <key>
```

Replace *<key\>* with a secret key which can be generated with `rake secret`.

#### User management

To use Hermes, you will need at least one user, which you can create with `RAILS_ENV=production rake "user:create[email,password]"`.

### Usage

You can start Hermes with `rails server -e production` or `rails server -e production -d` to run in the background.
